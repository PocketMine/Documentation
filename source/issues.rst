Issues
======

Check the following things and update if needed before making a new issue:

* PocketMine-MP version
* PHP binary version
* Plugin versions


When you have the latest version of those files, and the problem still occurs, making certain that a **plugin** is not the cause, then `make a new issue <https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/new>`_ on GitHub.

Give as much information as you can about when or what happened.
