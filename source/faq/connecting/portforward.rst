Do I have to configure port forwarding
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is only needed when you want people from outside your network to connect.
Check `portforward.com`_ or use `Google`_ to find the instructions. Use the brand and type of your router as keywords.

.. note::
    * UDP port: 19132 for PocketMine-MP and Query
    * TCP port: 19132 for RCON
